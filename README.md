This is an archive of my collaborators (Anthony Nguyen) and I (Faris Ari) first attempt at training a model. We scratched this repository because we have found more efficient ways to achieve the same outcome. This repository will be kept public for archiving purposes. Please refer Themisto for our updated project.

Thanks to all who bother to read this.
